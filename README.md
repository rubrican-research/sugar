# Sugar
(Syntax) Sugar libraries for FPC/Lazarus to make coding in Object Pascal a lot faster and easier.
This is work in progress. The package is working well. I rely on these for all my Lazarus dev work. Documentation is still to be done. Also, I would like to refactor some parts to iron out kinks in the developer experience. But overall, I find that I've been very productive with these libraries.

# Dependencies
1. [Delphi Markdown](https://github.com/grahamegrieve/delphi-markdown) - an excellent library to render markdown as html.
2. [RHL](https://github.com/maciejkaczkowski/rhl) - recALL Hash Library 16.07. This can be installed through the online package manager in Lazarus
